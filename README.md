# Aritzia Product Page Redesign

### Mission
I was recently tasked with identifying an objection that a shopper might encounter at any point throughout the shopping experience on www.aritzia.com. I had to come up with a theory about how such an obstacle could potentially be overcome, and then create a message that would be shown to the shopper to persuade them to complete the purchase.

### Initial Analysis
Aritzia is a Canadian retailer whose local stores I frequent whenever I go shopping but I've never actually been on their website. While exploring their online checkout process, I identified several elements that I thought could be improved. For example, the mobile experience isn't the greatest. I also noticed that certain pages like their "About" page were beautifully designed with fading transitions and pretty solid copy, but other pages (such as those associated with the online shopping process) were frustrating to navigate and didn't feel cohesive with the rest of the website's design.

Since this was supposed to be a short challenge as part of an employment opportunity, I narrowed it down to the product page and decided to focus on the desktop view.
